"""Run folder and manifest: where a run's files live, and how to show they are unchanged.

`create_run` makes runs/<run_id>/ with its config, an initial state and an empty manifest. As each
agent finishes, `Manifest.register` hashes the files its output lists. `Manifest.verify` later
confirms every file is still there and unchanged (architecture.md section 4, success criterion).

Paths in an agent output are relative to the run folder, or absolute inside it. Anything outside
the folder is refused, so an agent cannot write results somewhere the manifest does not cover.
